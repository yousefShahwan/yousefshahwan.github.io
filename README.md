Project Title: Home Automation System Using Telegram and ESP32

Overview
This project showcases a real-time home automation system built using the ESP32 microcontroller and integrated with the Telegram messaging app. The system allows users to control home appliances remotely via simple Telegram commands, offering a user-friendly and cost-effective solution for smart living.

Key Features

📱 Telegram-based user interface

🌐 Real-time control via Wi-Fi

🔌 Control of lights, fans, and sockets

⚡️ Built on ESP32 microcontroller

🛡️ Secure and responsive command handling

Technologies Used

ESP32 Microcontroller

Arduino IDE

Telegram Bot API

Relay Modules

Wi-Fi Network

How It Works
Once connected to a local Wi-Fi network, the ESP32 listens for messages sent to a custom Telegram bot. Each command triggers a specific GPIO pin, which then activates relays to control household devices. The system provides instant feedback, enhancing user confidence and usability.

Applications

Home lighting and appliance control

Remote power management

Energy saving and scheduling

Smart security features

Impact
This project demonstrates how accessible technologies can be combined to create powerful automation systems. It’s especially suitable for students, hobbyists, and engineers interested in IoT and smart home solutions.
